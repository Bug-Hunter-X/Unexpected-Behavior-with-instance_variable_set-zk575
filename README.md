This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Ruby related to directly modifying instance variables using `instance_variable_set`. While it's sometimes necessary, directly manipulating instance variables can lead to unexpected behavior and make code harder to maintain and debug.  It's usually better to use accessor methods (getters and setters) for managing instance variable values. The `bug.rb` file shows the problem and `bugSolution.rb` demonstrates a more robust solution.
